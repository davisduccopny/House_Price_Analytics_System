## Introduction
House price prediction is a crucial task in the real estate industry. This project aims to leverage the power of LSTM and RNN models to predict house prices based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and historical prices. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize the features.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of LSTM and RNN layers to capture temporal dependencies in the data. The architecture is designed to handle sequential data effectively.

## Training
The model is trained using the preprocessed dataset. Various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are tuned to optimize the model's performance.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Cross-validation is used to ensure the model's robustness.

## Results
The results section presents the model's performance on the test dataset. Visualizations such as loss curves and predicted vs actual price plots are included to illustrate the model's effectiveness.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the potential of LSTM and RNN models in predicting house prices. Future work may include exploring other model architectures and incorporating additional features.
