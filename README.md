## Introduction
House price prediction is a crucial task in the real estate industry. This project aims to leverage the power of **Linear Regression** and **RandomForestRegressor** to predict house prices based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and historical prices. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize the features for better model performance.

## Model Architecture
The project implements two models:
1. **Linear Regression** – A simple yet effective approach for predicting house prices based on feature relationships.
2. **RandomForestRegressor** – A robust ensemble learning method that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

## Training
The models are trained using the preprocessed dataset. Various hyperparameters such as the number of estimators (for RandomForestRegressor) and regularization techniques (for Linear Regression) are tuned to optimize performance.

## Evaluation
The models' performance is evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**. Cross-validation is applied to ensure model generalization.

## Results
The results section presents the model's performance on the test dataset. Visualizations such as residual plots and predicted vs actual price plots are included to illustrate the models' effectiveness.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the potential of **Linear Regression** and **RandomForestRegressor** in predicting house prices. Future work may include exploring additional machine learning models and incorporating more complex features for improved accuracy.
